# DP Catalog

This code runs the DP Catalog at https://www.pgdp.org/ols

Originally known as the "Open Library System" and hosted at
[Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openls/), the DP Catalog serves
as a catalog to the [Distributed Proofreader](https://www.pgdp.net) projects
that have been completed and published at
[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).
