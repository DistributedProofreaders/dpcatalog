Instructions for Installing/Upgrading the Open Library System website code

The instructions in this file assume that you're using a release tarball from
the github.com project:

=======================================================================
Installing from scratch
-----------------------

This section assumes that you don't have an existing installation of OLS
If you're upgrading from a previous version, see the upgrade section.

--- Install PHP.
        Version: We know that the code runs on version 5.3.x.

        Enable the CLI for running installation scripts, cron jobs and
        any future upgrade scripts.

        php.ini:
            No known requirements/dependencies.

--- Install MySQL.
        Version: We know that our queries work on 5.5.x.
        We believe that they'll work on any version from 4.0.14 up.

        In the examples in this document, we will assume that the mysql server
        is on "localhost", i.e. the same host on which you are running these
        commands, and the same host that runs the webserver.

--- Install gettext and xgettext.
        If you want to localize the site messages. Note that this functionality
        is not yet fully implemented in the OLS code.

--- Choose names for various MySQL items:
        --- the OLS database (to house the OLS data);
        --- the OLS user (to handle all OLS queries);
        --- the OLS user's password.

    Don't choose a password that contains an apostrophe (single-quote),
    as it confuses the code.

    In the examples in this document, we will use
        ols_db
        ols_user
        ols_password
    for these three items. You may wish to choose names that are harder for
    others to guess (especially for the password!).

--- Set up MySQL to create the database and user:
        There are various ways to do each of these.
        We'll show how to do it using the mysql client.

    --- Connect to the MySQL server as the root user, or any sufficiently
        powerful user.
            mysql -h localhost -u root -p

    --- Create the database.
            CREATE DATABASE ols_db;
        If you have MySQL 4.1.1 or higher:
            CREATE DATABASE ols_db CHARACTER SET UTF8;
        Note that you can have UTF-8 enabled on the site even if you have an
        older MySQL version which doesn't support it.

    --- Create the user.
        (See MySQL Manual 5.5.4 Adding New Users to MySQL.)
            GRANT ALL ON ols_db.* TO ols_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'ols_password';
   
    --- Exit from the mysql client.
            quit;

--- Unpack the OLS code.
        Unpack the OLS code and move the src/ directory somewhere within your
        server's document hierarchy (possibly, though not necessarily, in the
        document root). Here, we will assume a directory under the document
        root named 'ols'.

        Only the contents of the src/ directory should be exposed via the web
        server.

--- Configure the OLS code (with site-specific settings).
        Make an editable copy of SETUP/configuration.sh, and put it outside
        your webserver's document hierarchy.

        Modify your copy of configuration.sh as appropriate. Details about each
        parameter are included in configuration.sh.

        Run:
            SETUP/configure path-to-modified-configuration.sh path-to-code-dir
        The configure script will use your modified configuration.sh to update
        the code with your site-specific settings.

--- Create the tables of the OLS database.
        You may need to update the $relPath variable at the top of the
        install_db.php file to point to the location of the OLS src/
        directory you unpacked above.

        cd SETUP
        php -f install_db.php

--- At this point, your OLS site should be functional.
        Try visiting it via your browser.
        Of course, there aren't any projects in the catalog yet.

=======================================================================
Upgrading
---------

This section assumes that you have an existing installation of OLS, and
that it has data that you want to bring forward as you upgrade to a
newer release of the OLS code.

--- Back up your data.

--- Move the old code aside.
        mv ols ols.old
    (Don't remove it just yet. It may have files you need.)

--- Create a new 'ols' directory and unpack the new OLS code in it.

--- Configure the new OLS code with your site-specific settings.
    (Follow the instructions above in the 'Installing from scratch' section.)

--- Upgrade your database schema and data, if necessary.
    This usually involves running PHP scripts from the command-line.

    Currently there are no upgrade scripts necessary, although this may
    change with future releases.

    Upgrade scripts will be added under the SETUP directory and include
    specific instructions.

    To run the upgrade scripts, you must cd into the directory and invoke the
    scripts from there. E.g.:
        
            cd ols/SETUP/upgrade/01/
            php -f some_upgrade_script.php
            ...

    It's a good idea to log the shell I/O (e.g., using the 'script' command),
    as this may help diagnose any problems you have.

    The order in which you invoke the scripts shouldn't matter.

    Each script will print 'Done!' if it completes without fatal errors.

--- At this point, your OLS site should be functional again.
